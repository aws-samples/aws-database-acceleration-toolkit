1. DAT is developed using Terraform to automate the provisioning of resources and security with declarative infrastructure and policy as code. The source code is served from Git repository for easy collaboration and version control. 
2. DAT can be deployed in two ways to provision the Amazon Aurora cluster in AWS Cloud. First approach is using Terraform Command Line Interface (CLI) to run DAT Blueprints directly which then invokes the terraform modules in the background. The other approach is to create Jenkins pipelines for DAT Blueprints and run these pipelines from Jenkins console. The pipelines will in turn invoke the terraform modules in the background when you run the pipelines from UI.
