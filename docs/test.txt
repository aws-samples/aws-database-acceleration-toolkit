The Database Acceleration Toolkit (DAT) is comprised of various examples, each designed to address specific functionalities and tasks related to Amazon Aurora databases. Clicking on each link provides detailed information on running these examples:

aurora-postgres-cluster-existing-vpc: This example focuses on creating a new Aurora PostgreSQL Cluster within an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It guides users through the process of setting up a new Aurora PostgreSQL cluster, allowing them to specify configurations within their existing VPC environment.

db-proxy-to-existing-postgres-cluster: This example demonstrates the creation of a proxy specifically tailored to an existing Aurora PostgreSQL cluster. It assists in the setup of a proxy that efficiently manages connections to an already established Aurora PostgreSQL cluster, enhancing connection reliability and performance.

aurora-postgres-cluster-global-db: This example is centered around establishing new Aurora PostgreSQL Clusters in both primary and secondary regions. It enables the creation of Aurora PostgreSQL clusters in multiple regions, ensuring data replication and high availability across different geographical locations.

aurora-monitoring: This example focuses on setting up a monitoring dashboard dedicated to Aurora databases. It guides users through the process of configuring monitoring tools and dashboards using Amazon CloudWatch, allowing for the efficient monitoring of vital performance metrics and database health.

aurora-postgres-cluster-latest-snapshot: This example provides guidance on deploying an Aurora PostgreSQL Database Cluster using the latest available cluster snapshot. It facilitates the creation of an Aurora PostgreSQL cluster by restoring from the most recent snapshot, ensuring quick and reliable deployment based on the latest state of the database.

These examples serve as practical guides, offering step-by-step instructions and automation scripts for executing various operations related to Amazon Aurora databases. They aim to simplify complex tasks, streamline setup procedures, and empower users to effectively manage and leverage the capabilities of Aurora databases within their specific environments.
